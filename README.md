# MarinePitch

I have created two functionalities which are swimming underwater and a boid algorithm to create Flocking fishes with various features with respect to the flocking behavior of the fish.

I am using the URP pipeline to maintain a very smooth FPS for Quest 2. I have used fog settings to make it more realistic and have an underwater marine vibe to the project.
I have optimized my prefabs and vegetation to make the project run with high fps and particle system to show bubbles that are caused while breathing underwater using an oxygen kit and swimming gear.
I am using ATLAS to make the terrain data as optimized as possible which makes my terrain render easily without any GPU instancing issues or load balancing issues for VR.
I am using custom gravity and swimming scripts for player swimming movement and flocking scripts for fish spawning and their respective behavior in the scene.

All underwater vegetation is optimized and does not hamper my gameplay. The gameplay is clocking at 90+fps.
